BigO Notation for Insertion- Time complexity: O(nÂ²) Space complexity: O(n)

BigO Notation for Reverse List- Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n)

Insertion Sort is used in my insertionSortHairByLength function to sort hair objects by length.
It builds the sorted array one element at a time and it compares the current element to the sorted portion of the array and inserts it into the correct position.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It calculates the shortest path in terms of cumulative distance or cost, assuming the graph has no negative edge weights.
